# Image-Captioning-using-Attention-mechanism

## Attention models
Attention models, or attention mechanisms, are input processing techniques for neural networks that allows the network to focus on specific aspects of a complex input, one at a time until the entire dataset is categorized. ... Attention models require continuous reinforcement or backpopagation training to be effective.


## Image Captioning
Image Captioning is the process of generating textual description of an image. It uses both Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision to generate the captions.

## Encoder
The Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) can be thought of as an encoder. The input image is given to CNN to extract the features. The last hidden state of the CNN is connected to the Decoder.

## Decoder
The Decoder is a Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) which does language modelling up to the word level. The first time step receives the encoded output from the encoder and also the <START> vector.
