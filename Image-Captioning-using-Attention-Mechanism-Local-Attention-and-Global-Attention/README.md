Attention models, or attention mechanisms, are input processing techniques for neural networks that allows the network to focus on specific aspects of a complex input, one at a time until the entire dataset is categorized. ... Attention models require continuous reinforcement or backpopagation training to be effective.

Implemented Image Captioning Model using both Local and Global Attention Techniques and API'fied the model using FLASK
